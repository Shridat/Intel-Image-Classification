# Intel Image Classification Using Image Transformers
Welcome to the Intel Image Classifier project, where we delve into the world of image classification using cutting-edge techniques. This project aims to classify images from the Intel Image Classification dataset into six distinct categories: 'building', 'forest', 'glacier', 'mountain', 'sea', and 'street'.


## Description

In this project, we explore two distinct approaches to tackle the image classification task. Firstly, we embarked on a journey to develop Vision Transformers from scratch utilizing the power of PyTorch. Despite our efforts, the initial results yielded a modest accuracy of approximately 18% after 10 epochs. Undeterred, we sought to enhance the performance of our model.

Subsequently, we pivoted towards leveraging the advantages of pretrained Vision Transformers. By fine-tuning a pretrained model on our dataset, we aimed to capitalize on the wealth of knowledge already ingrained within the network. This approach proved to be instrumental in achieving higher accuracy levels, enabling us to surpass the limitations encountered with our initial implementation.
