# Intel-Image-Classification
The intel image classification dataset has 6 labels - 'building','forest','glacier','mountain','sea','street'. I have used two approaches. Firstly, I have created vision transformers from the scratch using PyTorch. I got very less accuracy nearly 18% for 10 epochs. To get more accuray, I have trained the dataset on pretrained vision transformer.
